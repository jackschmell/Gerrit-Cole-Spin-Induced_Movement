# Gerrit Cole Spin-Induced Pitch Movement Analysis

## About

This project focuses on analyzing Gerrit Cole's pitch movement induced by spin. It explores the relationship between spin rate and the movement of his pitches. The analysis involves visualizations and data interpretation to understand the impact of spin on the trajectory and behavior of Cole's pitches.
In addition, I was curious to see what changes Cole made from his 2022 season to his 2023 season to become the AL Cy Young winner.

## Features

- Visualization of pitch movement based on spin rate
- Comparative study of different pitch types and their spin-induced movement

## Data Collection
The Data For this was scraped from the baseball savant website using the baseballr package

## Analysis
Pitches Cole through were grouped together based on the pitch type and plotted according based on their horizontal and vertical spin induced movement. First, we have the 2022 pitch movement chart. Each pitch type is indicated by a different color

Next, we have the 2023 spin induced pitch movement chart. Again, each pitch is grouped by color.

From the comparison of the two charts, it is clear that Cole's cutter had much more movement in 2023 than it did in 2022. This will most definitely get hitters off balance and increases the effectives of a secondary pitch, behind his dominatant 4-Seam Fastball. 

To see just how much more movement the cutter generated in 2023 compared to 2022, here is a chart showing the average overall movement of each pitch type(calculuated using the Pythagorean theorem) in these two years :

The table varifies the results we saw in the table. Cole's cutter had much more spin induced movement in 2023 than in 2022. Rounded, on average, the cutter moved about 2.6 more inches in the latter year!






## Results
From the Data Visualization, it seems one telling difference between 2022 and 2023 seams to be the increased total spin induced movement on his Cutter.
